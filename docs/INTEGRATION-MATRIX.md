# Feature Integration Matrix

Quick reference for ensuring new features integrate properly across the my-family architecture.

---

## Quick Reference

**For any new feature, answer these questions:**

1. **Does it change state?** - Needs events, commands, projections
2. **Does it store data?** - Needs PostgreSQL + SQLite implementations
3. **Does it have a UI?** - Needs frontend component
4. **Is it a GEDCOM concept?** - Needs import/export support
5. **Is it searchable?** - Needs search integration
6. **Does it affect quality?** - Needs QualityService updates
7. **Is it user-facing?** - Needs 85% test coverage

| Branch | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | Complete |

Legend: ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Partial/Needed | ❌ Missing | N/A Not applicable

The **Branch** column means "this entity can be written on a research branch"
([ADR-005](./adr/005-research-branch-data-model.md); `?branch=` on the API). ❌ means main-only —
the API does not expose `?branch=` on those operations, and an event-sourced write attempted on a
branch scope is rejected with `ErrEventTypeNotBranchAware` (BR-006). Widening this is
[#676](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/676). The column says nothing about branch
*reads*: the browse and map aggregates are branch-aware without being entities of their own — see
[Branch coverage detail](#branch-coverage-detail-669-read--670-write--756-aggregates) below.

Notes on partial rows:

- **LifeEvent / Attribute**: no dedicated CRUD commands or API endpoints; only bulk export (`/export/events`, `/export/attributes`).
- **Snapshot**: event-sourced since [#624](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/624) — `Handler.CreateSnapshot` / `DeleteSnapshot` emit `SnapshotCreated` / `SnapshotDeleted` and the projection writes the registry, so snapshots created from that point on rebuild from the log. Rows predating #624 have no event and would not survive a rebuild (see ADR-005 "Still open"); rebuild tooling ([#680](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/680)) must backfill them. GEDCOM is N/A (a research marker is not a genealogy record). The Branch column is ❌ rather than N/A: a snapshot *taken on a branch* is meaningful (ADR-005) but the registry has no `branch_id` column yet, so both commands refuse on a branch-scoped handler.
- **Branch**: create, delete/archive (#670) and merge ([#55](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/55), delivered) are implemented, with list/get/compare queries and a `/branches` API. `BranchMerged` is emitted by `Handler.claimMerge` and projected to the registry. The frontend surface (switcher, banner, `/branches` list and comparison view) ships with [#94](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/94) and [#95](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/95): `/branches/{id}` is the merge review, so `POST /branches/{id}/merge` is driven from the UI — conflict resolution, per-entity exclusion, and the merge itself. GEDCOM and the Branch column are N/A: a branch is not a genealogy record and cannot itself live on a branch.

### Branch coverage detail (#669 read / #670 write / #756 aggregates)

Seven read-model types carry a `branch_id` of their own and are branch-aware by copy-on-write
overlay (#669). Branch **writes** cover a narrower set, because a write also needs a branch-scoped
command path:

| Read-model type | Branch reads (#669) | Branch writes (#670) | How it is written on a branch |
|---|---|---|---|
| Person | ✅ | ✅ | `createPerson` / `updatePerson` / `deletePerson` |
| PersonName | ✅ | ✅ | `addPersonName` / `updatePersonName` / `deletePersonName` |
| Family | ✅ | ✅ | `createFamily` / `updateFamily` / `deleteFamily` |
| FamilyChild | ✅ | ✅ | `addChildToFamily` / `removeChildFromFamily` |
| PedigreeEdge | ✅ | ✅ | derived — reprojected from branch-scoped child link/unlink |
| PersonExternalID | ✅ | ❌ | written only by GEDCOM import, which is main-only by design (#670 non-goal) |
| FamilyExternalID | ✅ | ❌ | same as PersonExternalID |

Those 11 write operations plus 5 reads (`listPersons`, `getPerson`, `getFamily`, `getPersonNames`,
`getPedigree`) were the original #669/#670 slice. Sub-issue A of #676
([#756](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/756)) added six aggregate reads that derive from
that slice's overlay and own no `branch_id` column of their own:

| operationId | Method | Path |
|---|---|---|
| `browseSurnames` | GET | `/browse/surnames` |
| `getPersonsBySurname` | GET | `/browse/surnames/{surname}/persons` |
| `browsePlaces` | GET | `/browse/places` |
| `getPersonsByPlace` | GET | `/browse/places/{place}/persons` |
| `getPersonsByCemetery` | GET | `/browse/cemeteries/{place}/persons` |
| `getMapLocations` | GET | `/map/locations` |

That is **22 API operations carrying `?branch=`**. Treat `internal/api/openapi.yaml` as the count
of record — the drift test described below re-derives it from the spec on every run.

The frontend mirrors exactly those 22 in `isBranchScopedRequest()`
(`web/src/lib/api/client.ts`), matching on method as well as path — `POST /families` takes
`?branch=` while `listFamilies` does not. The free-text `{surname}` and `{place}` segments are
matched as a single non-empty, non-slash segment rather than as a UUID, so a percent-encoded place
name still resolves. A drift test in `web/src/lib/api/client.test.ts` parses `openapi.yaml` and
fails in **both** directions, so the allowlist cannot silently fall behind the spec.

Branch scoping is no longer confined to the seven-type slice, so "everything else is main-only" is
not the rule. The surfaces that *are* still mainline-only while a branch is active render
`MainlineNotice.svelte`, so the UI never presents mainline data as branch data. Within browse and
map that is now exactly two: the cemetery **index** (`browseCemeteries`, which aggregates
`life_events` — no `branch_id` yet, [#757](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/757)) and
brick walls (not event-sourced, [#761](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/761)). The
surname index and per-surname list, the place index and per-place list, the per-cemetery person
list, and the map all follow the active branch. Grow the allowlist and the notice coverage together
as the remaining #676 sub-issues land.

**Isolation is complete for these types.** Branch writes never touch `main` (proven end to end in
`internal/api/branch_handlers_test.go`), and the command layer resolves its *reads* — existence
checks, validation, and the expected version — through the same branch overlay, so a branch
behaves like a normal working copy:

- A person, name, or family may be created on a branch and then edited, renamed, or deleted on that
  same branch; the mainline never sees any of it.
- Repeated edits to the same record on one branch work: the expected version comes from the
  branch's own row, which matches the per-`(stream_id, branch_id)` event version (BR-005).
- Records the branch has not touched still resolve to `main`, so corrections made on `main` after
  the branch was created show through (the deliberate "live overlay" of ADR-005).

Remaining gaps, both deliberate: GEDCOM import/export is main-only (a stated non-goal of #670), and
rollback is main-only (`Handler.rollbackEntity`). Widening branch writes to the entity types outside
the seven-type slice is [#676](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/676).

Merging a branch back into `main` is **not** a gap: [#55](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/55)
delivered the command and `POST /branches/{id}/merge`, and the merge *review* UI
([#95](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/95)) drives it from `/branches/{id}` — resolve
each conflict, or leave a whole entity behind as a `main` resolution. What is still outstanding is
partial merge ([#684](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/684)) and resumable merge
([#685](https://github.com/cacack/my-family/issues/685)): excluding an entity is not the same as
promoting a subset of one entity's changes.
